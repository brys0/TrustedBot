# TrustedBot
The TrustedBot is a bot for Discord written in Java using [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA), [JDA-Utilities](https://github.com/JDA-Applications/JDA-Utilities) and [lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer).
## Features
 - Musicplayer (YouTube, Soundcloud, Files via HTTP and more)
 - Image Commands (Nekos, Lizards, Cats, Dogs etc.)
 - Rainbow Six Siege Statistics
 - Twitch Notifications
 - Reddit Grabber (Send posts from Subreddits like /r/animemes into a Channel)
 - Credit-System (which is currently pretty useless)
 - Custom Textcommands
 - Aliases to create commands triggering another command with specific arguments
 - Some more commands with various features like UrbanDictionary or NumberFacts

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Bot using gradle.
3. Start the Bot for the first time to create the default config. It will shutdown right after creating it.
4. Fill out the config.yml, everything should be commented.
5. Launch the Bot again.

## Commands
